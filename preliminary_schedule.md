- 15:15-17:00 Working groups present results, identify future goals, etc.

## Roundtables (tentative!)

The idea of a roundtable is to get a set of 3-6 people working a lot in this area to identify the issues, spark a discussion and debate to identify the issues, and get the conversation flowing.  From these will arise points to work on in Day 2.  I realize I have not included everyone (but nearly) so feel free to volunteer, or modify a topic or suggest a new one.
